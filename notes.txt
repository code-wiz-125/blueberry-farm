WHY BLUEBERRIES???

Blueberries are considered a superfood because of their nutritional value and antioxidant content. 
They contain more antioxidants than any other common fruit or vegetable, and antioxidants have been linked to many health benefits, including:

Heart health
Blueberries can help reduce high cholesterol, 
high blood pressure, artery stiffness, and inflammation.

Anti-inflammatory
Blueberries contain flavonoids and anthocyanins, 
which reduce inflammation and boost immunity.

Brain health
Blueberries can help regulate mood, improve memory, 
and protect the brain from aging. Daily consumption has 
been found to slow memory impairments and motor coordination 
that are typically associated with aging.

Diabetes control
Blueberries are packed with antioxidants, minerals, and fibers, 
and have been called a diabetic superfood by the American Diabetes Association.
